# City Cost of Living Predictor

This project focuses on predicting the cost of living in cities around the world based on various factors such as rent, grocery index, restaurant cost index, local purchasing power, and other text-based features. It involves web scraping to gather data, preprocessing, modeling, and prediction using linear regression.

## Overview

Understanding the cost of living in different cities is crucial for various purposes, such as relocation, travel planning, or business expansion. This project aims to provide insights into the cost of living using machine learning techniques.

## Key Features

- **Web Scraping:** Utilizes web scraping techniques to collect data on cities from various sources, including cost of living indices and other relevant information.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and preprocesses the collected data, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and vectorizing text-based features.

- **Modeling:** Constructs a predictive model using linear regression, a supervised learning algorithm, to predict the cost of living based on the input features.

- **Prediction:** Predicts the cost of living for new cities based on the trained model and provides insights into the factors influencing the cost of living.

## Usage

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Run the web scraping script to gather data on cities and their associated cost of living indices.
  
2. **Preprocessing:**
   - Preprocess the collected data, including cleaning, encoding, and vectorizing text-based features.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Train a linear regression model using the preprocessed data to predict the cost of living.

4. **Prediction:**
   - Use the trained model to predict the cost of living for new cities based on their features.
